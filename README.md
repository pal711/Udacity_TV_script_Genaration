## Introduciton

In this project I have generated the fake script of a TV series leveraging LSTM

## Data

In this project, I have generated my own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs.  Part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons. 

## Training

The model is trained on GPU environment of Udacity. So the exact configuration of the training system is not avaialable to me. But I can say my personal laptop ( 4GB Ram, i3 3rd gen processor ) was not for the training task

## Results

The model is not trained on full data and it is quite a simple model. But still it produces decent results. Yes, the generated script are not perfect at this scale but the results it produces at this small scale is quite impressive.

## Further Enhancements
As I get more and more knowledgeable in NLP I will train more complex model to get better results.
